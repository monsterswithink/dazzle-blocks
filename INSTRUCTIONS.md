1) [CLONE REPO]: https://github.com/monsterswithink/dazzle-blocks/tree/main
2) [CODE GUIDE]: nextjs, tailwindcss4, shadcn/ui, app router, *not* './src' base url, liveblocks+tiptap editor provider, supabase as backend for fetching profile data, next-auth using @auth/core via authjs.dev for auth, fetching {vanityUrl} from session headers, use EnrichLayer API to scrape linkedin profile which requires linkedin URL--which we pass from the session data, user then routed to Profile page which displays a snapshot profile card --this is also the moment the EnrichLayer which scrapes linkedin in the background and returns a JSON response thats always dynamic and possibly null with the exception of the public_identifier field, we then store that in supabase, then load that into the resume-editor as blocks using liveblocks.  We store all enrichlayer profile types in ./types/resume.ts
3) [UPDATE]: Replace liveblocks provider with Velt â†’ https://docs.velt.dev/get-started/quickstart
4) [OBJECTIVE]: Create a one-to-one linkedin to resume builder where the user only ever has to manage their resume by updating linkedin.
